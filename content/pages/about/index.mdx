Every 2 weeks children from ages 9 - 13 get together at Avenue Library in Moston to make some awesome things with code. Games, puzzles, websites, you name it we make it. We have a lot of fun working and learning together.

We learn coding with the help of the follow technology:

-   Scratch
-   Raspberry Pi
-   Microbit
-   Python
-   HTML/CSS (websites)

Each lesson is led by our volunteers who guide the children through the code club projects or a devised project created by our club leader.

We regularly join in with the code club network competitions, which are really challenging and fun.

At the end of each session we show/play each others work to see how other's have created their projects.
